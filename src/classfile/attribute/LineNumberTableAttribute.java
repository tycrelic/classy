4.8.12 The LineNumberTable Attribute
The LineNumberTable attribute is an optional variable-length attribute in the
attributes table of a Code (ยง4.8.3) attribute. It may be used by debuggers to
determine which part of the Java virtual machine code array corresponds to a given
line number in the original source file. If LineNumberTable attributes are present
in the attributes table of a given Code attribute, then they may appear in any
order. Furthermore, multiple LineNumberTable attributes may together represent a
given line of a source file; that is, LineNumberTable attributes need not be one-toone
with source lines.
The LineNumberTable attribute has the following format:
LineNumberTable_attribute {
u2 attribute_name_index;
u4 attribute_length;
u2 line_number_table_length;
{ u2 start_pc;
u2 line_number;
} line_number_table[line_number_table_length];
}
The items of the LineNumberTable_attribute structure are as follows:
attribute_name_index
The value of the attribute_name_index item must be a valid
index into the constant_pool table. The constant_pool entry
at that index must be a CONSTANT_Utf8_info (ยง4.5.7) structure
representing the string "LineNumberTable".
attribute_length
The value of the attribute_length item indicates the length of
the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.
line_number_table_length
The value of the line_number_table_length item indicates the
number of entries in the line_number_table array.
line_number_table[]
Each entry in the line_number_table array indicates that the
line number in the original source file changes at a given point in
the code array. Each line_number_table entry must contain the
following two items:
 */
public class LineNumberTableAttribute extends AttributeInfo {

    public short lineNumberTableLength;
    public LineNumberEntry[] lineNumberTable;//[lineNumberTableLength];

    public static class LineNumberEntry {
/**
The value of the start_pc item must indicate the index into
the code array at which the code for a new line in the
original source file begins. The value of start_pc must be
less than the value of the code_length item of the Code
attribute of which this LineNumberTable is an attribute.
 */
        public short startPc;
        /**
The value of the line_number item must give the
corresponding line number in the original source file.
         */
        public short lineNumber;
    };
}
