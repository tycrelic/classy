/**
4.8.2 The ConstantValue Attribute
The ConstantValue attribute is a fixed-length attribute used in the attributes
table of the field_info (ยง4.6) structures. A ConstantValue attribute represents
the value of a constant field. There can be no more than one ConstantValue
attribute in the attributes table of a given field_info structure. If the field is
static (that is, the ACC_STATIC bit (Table 4.4) in the flags item of the field_info
structure is set) then the constant field represented by the field_info structure is
assigned the value referenced by its ConstantValue attribute as part of the initialization
of the class or interface declaring the constant field (ยง2.17.4). This
occurs immediately prior to the invocation of the class or interface initialization
method (ยง3.9) of that class or interface.
If a field_info structure representing a non-static field has a ConstantValue
attribute, then that attribute must silently be ignored. Every Java virtual machine
implementation must recognize ConstantValue attributes.
The ConstantValue attribute has the following format:
ConstantValue_attribute {
u2 attribute_name_index;
u4 attribute_length;
u2 constantvalue_index;
}
The items of the ConstantValue_attribute structure are as follows:
attribute_name_index
The value of the attribute_name_index item must be a valid
index into the constant_pool table. The constant_pool entry
at that index must be a CONSTANT_Utf8_info (ยง4.5.7) structure
representing the string "ConstantValue".
attribute_length
The value of the attribute_length item of a
ConstantValue_attribute structure must be 2.

     The value of the constantvalue_index item must be a valid
