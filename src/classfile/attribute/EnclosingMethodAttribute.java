/**
4.8.7 The EnclosingMethod Attribute
The EnclosingMethod attribute is an optional fixed-length attribute in the
attributes table of the ClassFile (ยง4.2) structure. A class must have an
EnclosingMethod attribute if and only if it is a local class or an anonymous
class. A class may have no more than one EnclosingMethod attribute.
The EnclosingMethod attribute has the following format:
EnclosingMethod_attribute {
u2 attribute_name_index;
u4 attribute_length;
u2 class_index
u2 method_index;
}
The items of the EnclosingMethod_attribute structure are as follows:
attribute_name_index
The value of the attribute_name_index item must be a valid
index into the constant_pool table. The constant_pool entry
at that index must be a CONSTANT_Utf8_info (ยง4.5.7) structure
representing the string "EnclosingMethod".
attribute_length
The value of the attribute_length item is four.

(ยง4.5.6) structure representing a the name and type of a method in
